Today's print is the [Hero ME Gen5 Master Suite](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4460970).
It is a really cool fan shroud for the Ender 3 Pro (and others). It is designed to give you cooling on all sides of your extruder.
Curretly the Ender 3 Pro OEM fan shroud only blows from one side. Making for poor cooling on opposite side of your print.

### Printing

Using [COEX PLA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B08VDRCLK5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08VDRCLK5&linkCode=am2&tag=hepaestus-20&linkId=1d9d5e1f6549ff354ed286c84becbbcb) in pink.

It will be similar to this once assembled.
