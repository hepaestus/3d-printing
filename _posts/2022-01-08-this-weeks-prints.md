I looked and looked all over Thingaverse and Thangs for printing inspiration but ultimately it was mostly my messy desk that inspired my prints. Also coffee; the espresso maker needed a coffee tamper.

### Print Results
- SLA Prints
  - Had bad results on my SLA printer for some reason. Not much to show for my efforts. I am going to recalibrate and see if I can fix things.
  - Also resin prints are very hard to photograph, especially, the white resin. Grey is much easier to get a decent pre-paint photo.
