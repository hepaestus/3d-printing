# 3d-printing (Updated December 3rd 2021)

Before you choose a 3d printer you should think ahead about what you want to print. Minis and jewelry and small parts are great for a resin printer. Larger parts like: toys, structural elements, anything large , etc. are probs best printed on an FDM printer. 

I am pretty happy with my Ender3Pro. Recently I have upgraded it from the stock model to make it even better. FDM Printers like the Ender3pro are harder to upkeep as they have many moving parts and are quite technical to operate. I have been looking into resin printers for high detail small parts like Dnd Minis and jewelry. Resin printers are fast, easy to use and provide great detail to your prints. They are much simpler than FDM printers as they have far fewer moving parts.

Small resin printers in the sub $250 range are basically the same as larger more expensive versions. They are perfect for minis and high detail projects. This is a great video on resin printing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNgtWLBs4tc&ab_channel=ZackFreedman.I watched this and I was immediately inspired to plan my next printer purchase for resin minis.

So far, I have an FDM printer, and it is pretty great. I have fun printing all sorts of stuff for fun and profits.

## My Setup 
- Ender 3 Pro ![Ender 3 Pro Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/1494/3382/products/KU_RLUV0ZYBV8_BLLV6W9O6_1024x1024.png?v=1603706565)
  - $209 https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-ender-3-pro-3d-printer
    - 3dPrinter, comes as a kit you have to assemble. This will make you familiar with it and you will be better later for installing upgrades 

### Current Ender 3 Pro Upgrades:
These are not required but make your printer work much better and easier:

## Resin Printers
![Photon Resin Printer](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0245/5519/2380/products/Photon_7_1800x1800.jpg?v=1586489285)
I am getting a printer like this one for printing minis and small parts: https://www.anycubic.com/collections/anycubic-photon-3d-printers/products/anycubic-photon-3d-printer. Also getting the [Wash and Cure Station 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JCSSTD5/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hepaestus-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08JCSSTD5&linkId=57b74f3e05d795dc64de733455e5f6f0) which is supposed to make clean up much easier.

## Other Printers Of Note
If you have a larger budget and larger ambitions, and or want to print super long/tall items, or a huge series or multiples this is what you would want :)  $+1K https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/cr-30-infinite-z-belt-3d-printer

## Stuff to print
Hero Forge has a great tool for designing custom gaming minis that you can download at STL files for your slicer.
- https://heroforge.com/
Eldritch Foundry is super cool
- https://eldritch-foundry.com/
My Mini Factory has tons of free minis to print. 
- https://www.myminifactory.com/
  
Here are a few places to get awesome things to print
- https://thangs.com/

## Software You Will Need
You can download ready to print files from the internet quite easily, but if you have an idea for a print you will need to render your idea in a drawing program. You will likely want to use a parametric drafting program to best create your models. There are also sculpting tools that will render STL files but I have not tried them.

Here are two options to try. Both are well supported with tons of video tutorials on youtube.
- Drawing/Modeling/Drafting Software
  - Fusion 360 (might be free for personal use)
    - Parametric Drafting software for creating and editing stl files to print.
      - https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal
  - FreeCad (free software)
    - Open Source (Free) Parametric Drafting software.
      - https://www.freecadweb.org/


Once you have a model to print, you will need "Slicer" software to convert your model to GCode your printer can understand. Slicers take STL files as input. Most slicers are pretty easy to use. Create a new project and import/open your stl files. Arrange then on the print plate and slice. 
- Slicers (I have tried)
  - Super Slicer 
    - This is an awesome slicer that is easy to use and 
    - https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/releases
      - Goto Assets and choose your OS.    
  - Cura 
    - https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura


Finally when you are printing you will want the best interface possible. For my Ender 3 Pro I use Octoprint. Octoprint connects to your printer and controls it remotely. You can use the web interface to upload files to print and track print progress and status. You can use additioinal plugins to create time lapse videos of your prints or send you an SMS when printing is done. 

- Octoprint: https://octoprint.org/ 
  - [Current Download](https://octoprint.org/download/)
    - SDCard Creation (for setting up octoprint)
      - [RaspberryPi Image Burner](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/)

## How do I do any of this? What do I do first?

* Buy a printer
  * Assemble the printer 
* Buy Raspberry Pi, SD Card, Power supply ( if your printer supports Octoprint)
  * Setup Octoprint
* Install Software
  * Drawing Software
    * Fusion 360
    * Others?
  * Slicing Software
    *  Cura
    *  Super Slicer
    *  Photon Workshop
