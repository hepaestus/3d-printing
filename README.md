# 3d-printing

Before you choose a 3d printer you should think ahead about what you want to print. Minis and jewelry and small parts are great for a resin printer. Larger parts like: toys, structural elements, anything large , etc. are probs best printed on an FDM printer. 

I am pretty happy with my Ender3Pro. Recently I have upgraded it from the stock model to make it even better. FDM Printers like the Ender3pro are harder to upkeep as they have many moving parts and are quite technical to operate. I have been looking into resin printers for high detail small parts like Dnd Minis and jewelry. Resin printers are fast, easy to use and provide great detail to your prints. They are much simpler than FDM printers as they have far fewer moving parts.

Small resin printers in the sub $250 range are basically the same as larger more expensive versions. They are perfect for minis and high detail projects. This is a great video on resin printing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNgtWLBs4tc&ab_channel=ZackFreedman.I watched this and I was immediately inspired to plan my next printer purchase for resin minis.

So far, I have an FDM printer, and it is pretty great. I have fun printing all sorts of stuff for fun and profits.

    - 3dPrinter, comes as a kit you have to assemble. This will make you familiar with it and you will be better later for installing upgrades 

### Upgrades:
These are not required but make your printer work much better and easier:
