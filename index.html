    <p><strong>Printing</strong>... if you have ever setup a printer or worked in an office and had to print stuff, you
      know how frustrating printing can be. From the drivers to the network, to the paper tray, it&#39;s all annoying and can
      ruin your print experience at any time. 2D Printing on paper has been a challenge for office workers since they
      came on the market. In fact printers are so annoying they made a movie about it.</p>
    <p><img alt="Office Space - Advanced Printer Destrucion"
        src="https://acegif.com/wp-content/uploads/office-space-gifs-113.gif"> </p>
    <p>3d printing <em>can</em> be just as frustrating and annoying as any printer you have ever used. Imagine that 40
      page assignment you had to have for your professor/boss that would not print properly. 3D printing is just like that,
      except, you cannot simply print page 38 over again and be ok. Since they build directly upon the layer below, if a
      layer(page) is not almost perfect the next layer will also not be perfect and it will build on that small error
      compounding over time into a failed print.</p>
    <p>That said you can do a lot to make sure your print succeeds. From choosing the right printer, and the right
      filament. To leveling your print bed properly, and choosing the necessary slicer settings. You too can dial in your printer
      just right.</p>
    <h2 id="what-kind-of-printer-should-i-get-">What kind of printer should I get?</h2>
    <p>Before you choose a 3d printer you should think ahead about what you want to print. Minis, jewelry, and small
      parts are great for a DLP resin printer. Larger parts like: toys, structural elements, anything large , etc. are probs
      best printed on an FDM filament printer.</p>
    <p>I am pretty happy with my Ender3Pro FDM printer. Recently I have upgraded it from the stock model to make it even
      better. FDM Printers like the Ender3pro are harder to upkeep as they have <strong>many</strong> moving parts and
      are quite technical to operate. I have been looking into resin printers for high detail small parts like Dnd Minis and
      jewelry. Resin printers are fast, easy to use and provide great detail to your prints. They are much simpler than
      FDM printers as they have far fewer moving parts.</p>
    <p>The Ender 3 pro is no longer produced and has been replaced by the Ender 3 v2. Check out this great video on its
      pro and cons: <a href="https://youtu.be/sbRHZUnmfYw">https://youtu.be/sbRHZUnmfYw</a></p>
    <p>Small resin printers in the sub $250 range are basically the same as larger more expensive versions. They are
      perfect for minis and high detail projects. This is a great video on resin printing: <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNgtWLBs4tc&amp;ab_channel=ZackFreedman">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNgtWLBs4tc&amp;ab_channel=ZackFreedman</a>.
      I watched this and I was immediately inspired to plan my next printer purchase for resin minis.</p>
    <p>So far, I have an the most experience with FDM printers and I am just getting started with resin. </p>
    <p>Despite all the frustration and difficulty I have a lot of fun printing all sorts of stuff for fun and profits. I
      have compiled the information here in an effort to help others who are interested in the 3d printing world.</p>

    <p>These are not required. I used a stock ender 3 for more than a year before any upgrades at all. Now I think it
      performs better and it&#39;s super fun to tinker with and improve your printer. Here are the upgrades I have done,
      in roughly the order I did them.</p>
    <h4 id="raspbeery-pi-with-the-octoprint-print-controller">Raspbeery Pi With the Octoprint Print Controller</h4>
    <p>If our printer supports it, you should set up an Octoprint print server. It provides a web interface to send jobs
      to your printer and basically control all of it&#39;s functions remotely.</p>

        model. Now I think they come stock with the better 4.2.2 or 4.2.7. </li>

    <h2 id="software-you-will-need">Software You Will Need</h2>
    <p>You can download ready to print files from the internet quite easily, but if you have an idea for a print you
      will
      need to render your idea in a drawing program. You will likely want to use a parametric drafting program to best
      create your models. There are also sculpting tools that will render STL files but I have not tried them.</p>
    <p>Here are two options to try. Both are well supported with tons of video tutorials on youtube.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drawing/Modeling/Drafting Software<ul>
          <li>Fusion 360 (might be free for personal use) I have the most experience with this.<ul>
              <li>Parametric Drafting software for creating and editing stl files to print.<ul>
                  <li><a
                      href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal">https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal</a>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>FreeCad (free software) I have never sucessfully used this to create a model. I have not given it the
            attention I have given Fusion 360.<ul>
              <li>Open Source (Free) Parametric Drafting software.<ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">https://www.freecadweb.org/</a></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have a model to print, you will need &quot;Slicer&quot; software to convert your model to GCode your
      printer
      can understand. Slicers generally take STL files as input. Most slicers are pretty easy to use. Create a new
      project
      and import/open your stl files. Arrange them on the print plate and slice. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slicers (I have tried)<ul>
          <li>Super Slicer <ul>
              <li>This is an awesome slicer that is easy to use and </li>
              <li><a

                  <li>Goto Assets and choose your OS. </li>
                </ul>

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally when you are printing you will want the best interface possible. For my Ender 3 Pro I use Octoprint.
      Octoprint connects to your printer and controls it remotely. You can use the web interface to upload files to
      print
      and track print progress and status. You can use additioinal plugins to create time lapse videos of your prints or
      send you an SMS when printing is done. Watch or check on your print remotely via webcam.</p>
